This example demonstrates a common error when using the sum() method in Groovy with nested lists. The sum() method is designed to operate on a flat list of numbers. When given a nested list, it will throw a 'groovy.lang.MissingMethodException' because it doesn't know how to handle the inner lists. This repository provides a simple example showcasing this issue and a solution involving flattening the list before summation.
